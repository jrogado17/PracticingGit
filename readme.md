This is a repo for learning git
adding new text here:
Start by making some changes. Open your README.md and change the text so that it displays a different message.

Run a command to add these changes to the staging area. Then run a different command to check if that file was staged.

Run a command that creates a new commit.

Push this new commit from your local machine to Github.

Refresh your Github page again and your README.md text changes should display.
